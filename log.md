# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: My first log entry for #100daysofcode. i just Continued progress on replicating youtube player page as a task from [theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com).. I used a css library called fontawesome that have bunch of icons similar to youtube's instead of creating the pictures myself... still working to position things..

**Thoughts:** I got a hard time positioning the elements.. had to experiment bunch of properties like display styles, moving the elements using margins and float.

**Link to work:** [Not done](url here)
